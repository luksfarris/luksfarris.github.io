<p>Among the things I have purported to be, I am an artist, a musician/producer, a natural athlete and a game developer.
    To tell you the truth I am an <a href="#" target="_blank">average artist</a>, I've only produced <a href="#"
        target="_blank">bad stuff</a> for myself, I made some <a href="#" target="_blank">shitty games</a>, and I won't
    even link to any sports.
</p>
<p>I am a young adult based in SÃ£o Paulo. Taller than most people, and a little overweight (hopefully not for long).
    White male, brunette, brown eyes. I'm avarage on every aspect. Extremely nice and polite, maybe too much. If I
    wanted to ask you a question, I'd probably start off by asking for permission to do so. My alignment in D&amp;D
    would be lawful good, nerds.</p>
<p>Now for some facts: I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am pursuing a MSc degree in machine learning
    and bioinformatics. I work (and have worked for a while) as a software engineer.</p>
<p>This is a personal experience. I found that writing about myself helps me discover aspects of my life I was unaware
    of, prior to thinking about it. In this site I will share my experiences and thoughts.</p>
<p>Stay tuned</p>
