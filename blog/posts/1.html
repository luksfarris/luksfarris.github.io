<h2>On Depression<span>And the post modern drama of a lost generation</span></h2>
<p>Maybe this has to do with my latest growing addiction to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dpat" target="_blank">dpat</a>, but maybe listening to it is just a reason to write. The subtitle is aggressive, on purpose. I consider my generation (born in the early 90's) lost. Not lost as in useless or failed. Lost as in we don't know where to go, nor where we are.</p>
<p> We were taught a supposedly perfect recipe for a good life: <strong>Study hard, build a career, create a family, retire, die</strong>. Kids my age recently graduated, or are about to. You know what I see? A bunch of people who wanted to be artists, musicians, and many other lost dreams; but became lawyers, engineers, and doctors.</p>
<p> This situation is the cause for the disease I call post modern drama (I've had it for about five years), which many times lead to the following symptoms - you probably have a good portion of them:</p>
<p>
- Stress</br>
- Distress</br>
- Apathy</br>
- Insomnia</br>
- Depression</br>
</p>
<p>There are deeper problems, such as failed relationships, shitty jobs, procrastination, sedentarism. Is there a better way to die inside? I often spend nights awoken, sitting on the edge of my bedroom window, gazing upon the empty streets. Thinking about jumping. Just thinking, I'll never jump; I still have too many dreams, too many unfinished projects. The thought of it somehow brings me peace.</p>
<p>Don't stop dreaming</p>
