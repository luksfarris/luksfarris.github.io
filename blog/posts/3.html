<h2>Photographs<span>And lying to yourself</span></h2>

<p>I despise photographs. And not because I look horrible on them. There was a time in my life when I was very sad,
    miserable indeed. One day I glanced at a picture frame, and the people there were smiling. Even though they didn't
    like each other, they were together smiling. That marked me. Photos became lies to me ever since. There were moments
    in my life I was very happy, and I don't feel the need to remember them. When I do remember them, I suddenly feel
    good, and that is enough.</p>
<p>I recently took an E. Schein psychological test and the first time I filled in the answers I was not satisfied.
    Something was wrong. I asked a few questions to someone close to me, and the way the person described me was
    different from who I was portraying in the answers. Funny. Who I think I am is different from who I act like.</p>
<p> I ended up rewriting the whole thing, and the results explained so much about me, it was shocking. I admit to a
    little scepticism, but it turns out it made me see why I wasn't happy on my previous job and the reason I'm happy
    on the new one. Also how to make it even better. Of course the test is for my present self, it's a photograph of my
    personality today, but how fast do we really change? And at least on this picture there are no lies.</p>
<p>As Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet:</p>
<p><code>This above all: to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell, my blessing season this in thee!</code></p>
