<h2>Freedom<span>Versus Propaganda</span></h2>

<blockquote>"I had a dream in which everyone was born free" - Gali. <i>Expansion of Conscience</i>, 2017.</blockquote>

<p>This sentence got me thinking that, in 2017, this poet believes we as a society are not free. I've always boasted about being free, and doing whatever I want. As a white, upper-middle class, kind-of-christian male, I reap all the privileges I can in an Eastern European country. Namely:</p>
<p>
- Eat high quality meals</br>
- Live in a safe city</br>
- A big and comfortable home</br>
- Friends and "family"</br>
- Alcohol and its friends</br>
- Casual sex</br>
</p>
<p> There, all instinctive needs checked. Nevertheless, freedom is not about needs. It's about desire. Doing as you desire, and in that sense, I am limited by money, and therefore not free. Therefore a slave of production means. Of capitalism. Capital. Well, I could think about what I really want, and adapt it to seek achievable goals. The other way is getting more money. I am not happy with these. One limits me, the other intrinsically limits those around me. I am not happy.</p>
<p>I invite the reader for a scientific investigation. Assuming that which we desire originates in corrupted reflexions of social media (may be a false pretense) is there a correlation between the use of such tools and sense of accomplishment? More than that, is there a less empirical, but theoretical way to find such relationships? I want to propose an answer to the theoretical part. With 3 assumptions:</p>
<p>
1. Social media relies on advertisements</br>
2. Companies advertise to attract people possibly convert them into consumers</br>
3. People rely on social media for a social life</br>
4. From 1 and 2, we conclude that people that use social media are highly exposed to ads, and have high probability of becoming consumers</br>
5. From 3 and 4, we all become consumers</br>
</p> 
<p>
Once we are all consumers, we as such need that which can't be bought, making freedom impossible. The lack of capital is a mere condition, a symptom of a disease that lies deeper within. Deep inside user experience psychology, social anxiety, and propaganda. I do not have the resources to deliver the empirical experiment, but I strongly believe the logic above. The conclusion: <b>freedom and exposure to propaganda are mutual exclusive</b>. You cannot have both.</p>

<p>Back to the poet, he had a dream in which people weren't over exposed to advertisement.</p>
