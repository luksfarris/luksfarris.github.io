<blockquote>"I had a dream in which everyone was born free" - Gali. <i>Expansion of Conscience</i>, 2017.</blockquote>

<p>This sentence got me thinking that, in 2017, this poet believes we as a society are not free. I've always boasted
    about being free, and doing whatever I want. As a white, upper-middle class, kind-of-christian male, I reap all the
    privileges I can in an Eastern European country. Namely:</p>
<p>
    - Eat high quality meals</br>
    - Live in a safe city</br>
    - A big and comfortable home</br>
    - Friends and "family"</br>
    - Alcohol and its friends</br>
    - Casual sex</br>
</p>
<p> There, all instinctive needs checked. Nevertheless, freedom is not about needs. It's about desire. Doing as you
    desire, and in that sense, I am limited by money, and therefore not free. Therefore a slave of production means. Of
    capitalism. Capital. Well, I could think about what I really want, and adapt it to seek achievable goals. The other
    way is getting more money. I am not happy with these. One limits me, the other intrinsically limits those around me.
    I am not happy.</p>
<p>I invite the reader for a scientific investigation. Assuming that which we desire originates in corrupted reflexions
    of social media (may be a false pretense) is there a correlation between the use of such tools and sense of
    accomplishment? More than that, is there a less empirical, but theoretical way to find such relationships? I want to
    propose an answer to the theoretical part. With 3 assumptions:</p>
<p>
    <b>A1.</b> Social media relies on advertisements.</br>
    <b>A2.</b> Companies use advertising to attract people and potentially convert a sale.</br>
    <b>A3.</b> People rely on social media for a social life.</br>
</p>
<p>
    <b>H1.</b> From <i>A1</i> and <i>A2</i>, we conclude that people that use social media are highly exposed to ads,
    and have a high probability of becoming consumers.</br>
    <b>H2.</b> From <i>A3</i> and <i>H1</i>, anyone that seeks a social life is fated to consumerism.</br>
</p>
<p>
    Once we are all consumers all the time, we as such need that which can't be bought, making freedom impossible. The
    lack of capital is a mere condition, a symptom of a disease that lies deeper within. Deep inside user experience and
    behavioural psychology, social anxiety, and propaganda. I do not have the resources to deliver the empirical
    experiment, but I strongly believe the logic above. The conclusion:
    <b>freedom and exposure to propaganda are mutual exclusive</b>.
    You cannot have both.</p>

<p>Back to the poet, he had a dream in which people weren't over exposed to advertisement.</p>
