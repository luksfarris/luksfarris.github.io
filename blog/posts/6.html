<h2>Respect<span>And the demons of Opinion</span></h2>

<p>I have a female friend that wants to be a drag queen. This is the perfect opportunity to talk about demons.</p>

<p>When I say demon, I'm not citing some mythological creature that crawled out of an uber hot place to possess a
    random person.
    No, the demon is what's inside our heads, disguised as selfishness, sadness, anger, lust, and many more.</p>

<p>My friend is a demon. So is the girl in the red dress (incidentally) that asked me to go to her place at 2am for "a
    beer". So is the Muslim guy at work. So is the fat kid that works at KFC.
    They are all manifestations of my ignorant thoughts and desires.
    They feed on our bad thoughts, and manifest ultimately as reckless actions.</p>

<p>Demons hunt like wolves, always in packs, and there's always an alpha.
    Some survival savvy: When dealing with a pack of wolves, always give your 100% to hurt the alpha.
    The others will try to stop you, but will back away if you deal great damage.
    The same works for demons. One of two things will happen: they will slowly disband, or another wolf will rise to the
    rank. I've never managed to completely kill my demons, perhaps my alpha is hiding deep within its lair.</p>

<p>I do not have the right to selfishly tell her to be who I want her to be.
    Dragging (no pun intended) someone else away from themselves is always damaging.
    If her behavior is good for her or not, is not a question I am allowed to ask.</p>

<p>Perhaps not even within my own thoughts.</p>
