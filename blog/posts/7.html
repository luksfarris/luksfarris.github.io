<p>Where is home ?</p>

<p>If you live abroad, chances are you get asked this question a lot.</p>

<p>Is it where you were born or where you grew up? Where you live, or where your parents live? Maybe where you wish you've lived, or your favorite travel destination?</p>

<p>Let me propose an exercise. Say you lose all your family, friends and everyone you've ever known. You lose your job, and all your possessions. You lose your identity and everything that makes you, you. </p>

<p>Under these circumstances you are offered a helicopter trip home. The pilot asks you where is your home, but he does not know you no longer have one. What do you answer?</p>

<p>Perhaps you want to stay where you are. Maybe you want to go where you grew up, or were born? Or even a whole new place, where you assume it'll be easier to start over. Regardless of your choice, the answer you provide the pilot is your home, at least in your heart.</p>

<p>What's keeping you from living there?</p>
