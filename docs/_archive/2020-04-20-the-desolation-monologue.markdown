## Play Script

`Actor(s): Atlas, girfriend, father, brother, Jesus`

`Atlas enters the scene. He carries a big heart divided into four pieces.`

`ATLAS` I believe God has been testing me.

`ATLAS` In the recent months I've been slowly regaining control of my spirituality. Ever since I moved to Europe, there hasn't been a way for me to go to mass, because I don't speak the language. Even before I moved here, going to mass felt like a duty,
not a spiritual practice. I didn't understand catholicism, and I didn't connect to it on a higher level.

`ATLAS` That has since changed, since I've learned there are other ways to interpret the bible. It's possible to read it not like a book of history, but as a book of stories, and to draw from those stories my own conclusions. That all being said, I also
    felt it was my duty to take responsibility for my family. 

`ATLAS` I've decided to take care of my girlfriend, who is very sick and is not working. 

`Girlfriend enters the stage from the left wearing hospital robes, takes a piece of heart from Atlas, and exits to the right.`

`ATLAS` She is all the time complaining about her health, and when one sickness goes away, another one comes long. It's really hard to give her emotional, physical, and financial support all the time. She does very little to clean the the aparment we
    rent, and doesn't take care of her dog, which means I get to do both.

`ATLAS` I've decided to resolve the legal problems my divorced parents have that should've been dealt with a long time ago. They don't speak to each other, so the problem lingered in courts and got way, way worse. None of my parents seem to be bothered
    enough to deal with it, even though it affects their every day life. 

`Father enters the stage from the right, he's on the phone gesturing broadly, he comes by and takes a piece from Atlas, leaves the stage.`

`ATLAS` My father, for example, takes weeks to do the simplest things and comes up with the worst excuses.

`ATLAS` I've decided to help my cousin finish the process of distributing the inheritance of my aunt that passed away more than an year ago. This got very complicated because our grandmother passed away years ago and her inheritance was never settled.
    Also, his father passed away recently and it complicates things even further. It's been tough to deal with it because my family members are not proactive in trying to solve it, and it takes them months to sign documents, and provide copies of their
    ids. Also there's the fact that my father took so long to pay the taxes to his part, that they expired, and I had to pay them for him.

`Father comes back from the left, still on the phone, takes another piece from Atlas, leaves the stage to the left, rushing.`

`ATLAS` I've decided to help my brother pay for an MBA degree in the most expensive university of Brazil. He lives like a king in Sao Paulo, as a of matter of fact right now he is traveling to Asia. 

`Brother enters the stage from the left wearing a king's robe. When he hears the next sentence, he waves a no sign to the audience. Gets angry, takes the last piece of heart and leaves the stage.`

`ATLAS` What upsets me is that he could live a less glamorous life, and he would have the money to pay for it, because he has a very good job.

`Atlas sits on the floor on a crouching position, embracing his own legs.`

`ATLAS` I've decided to be okay with having my mother in law living in our small apartment for over a month while she takes care of her own stuff. This was a very stressful experience.

`ATLAS` I've decided to take my girlfriend on a one-week-all-inclusive trip to some paradise island in Africa for her 30th birthday. 

`Girlfriend quickly crosses the stage holding candles.`

`ATLAS` This cost me a lot of money, over 4 months of saved salaries gone. Money I was saving to buy a house.

`Jesus enters the stage from the front, walking by the audience.`

`ATLAS` Jesus! You told me to be better than the laws of men. You told me not to look to other women. Not to feel hatred against my own brother. To love my father. How can I do this when you corrupt the ones I love?

`JESUS` You were the one who sought me. By helping them you become me. How can you expect to find peace when you can't love the flawed. Isn't it the jeweler who polishes the gems? Isn't it the winemaker who presses the grapes? __You too shall carry your world, just like I carried my cross__.
