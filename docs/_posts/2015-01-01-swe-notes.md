These notes are from some bits of paper I had laying on a drawer. I think this a summary of a summary of some college notes.

## SLDC

- Scrum VS Waterfall
- Lean SW Development: 
  - eliminate waste (problems, extra stuff, half done stuff)
  - amplify learning: short iterations, increasing feedback
- TDD, analytics, CI, ...
  - decide as late as possible
  - deliver as fast as possible
  - empower the team
  - build integrity
  - vision of the whole
- XP: pair programming, extensive code reviews, unit tests, avoiding new features until needed, flat management structure, frequent communication
- Scrum VS Kanban
- Defining technical feasibility
- Defining scope of unit tests: scenarios, requirements, boundaries, assertions, ...
- Code review: code guidelines, tests, architecture  

## Estimation

- cone of uncertainty: uncertainty is predictable, depending on stage of feature (from conception to development)
- source of errors: finding everything that can go wrong
- diseconomy of scale: scale of project is considered in estimations
- count > compute > judge
- delphi method: individual estimations, coordinator proposes value, group notes secretly if they agree. If one agrees, go back to discussion.
- problems of estimating size: depends on person, on project, maturity, ...
- problems of estimating effort: past projects and different industries may not be comparable
- problems of estimating schedule: can derive from the others, with historical data.
- story-based scoping
- PERT: statistical method of finding the minimum time possible to complete a project. It uses uncertainty not to take consideration of every activity.

## Software Requirements

- functional is what it should do
- non-functional is what it should be
- product champions are product owners
- user classes: features, tasks, privileges, frequency, ...
- SW quality attributes: availability, efficiency, integrity, usability, scalable
- assumptions vs constraints (risk analysis)
- modeling techniques: data dictionaries, data flow diagrams, MER (ERD)
- finding a product vision and keeping the scope

## Object Oriented Design

- Design Patterns:
  - Creational: abstract how objects are created. Singleton, factory, builder
  - Structural: compose classes and objects to form larger structure. Decorator, facade, adapter (when a class does not have the behavior you need)
  - Behavioral: algorithms and responsibility assignment. Observer, iterator, chain of responsibility.
- Layered Architecture: an application where logic is separated by layers. App, presentation, session, transport, network, data, ...
- MVC: model has data and functionality, view handles presentation, controller handles user input.
- IoC: dependency inversion, dependency injection. Populates the behavior with the appropriate implementation.
- SOLID:
  - Single responsibility: one reason to change
  - Open-Close: extend a class behavior, without modifying
  - Liskov substitution: subclasses must be able to replace super classes
  - Interface segregation: fine-grained interfaces
  - Dependency inversion: depend on abstraction
- Anti-Patterns
  - Cargo cult programming: stuff that serves no real purpose
  - Analysis Paralysis: over-thinking
  - Death march: people feel destined to fail

## DB Design

- MER: entities, relationships, attributes, normalization
- 1NF: attributes of a tuple must contain one single value
- 2NF: attributes are dependent on the key, not on each other
- 3NF: all non-key attributes are mutually independent (postal code not necessary)
- ACID:
  - Atomicity: all operations happen, or none happen
  - Consistency: transactions leave data in a consistent state
  - Isolation: user must see transactions happening one by one.
  - Durability: if a transaction is committed, its effects must not be lost
- RDBMS: physical - shared memory - server - client
- Transaction recovery: logs changes made by each transaction on stable storage
- Transaction locking: 2PL (2-phase locking), transactions require locks to perform and release them afterwards
- Transaction isolation: transactions may run in parallel, but they must seem serialized. Locking + time stamping + concurrency control
- Transaction concurrency control by distributed locking
- Denormalization can be useful when we want redundancy

## Modeling

UML: Unified Modeling Language
- Class diagrams: classes with functions and variables
  - → arrows are associations
  - ⇾ arrows is a generalization
- Sequence diagrams
- State machine diagrams
- package diagrams (java -> util -> date)
- MER

## Algorithms

- sorting
  - bubble (n^2)
  - merge (n*log(n))
  - quick sort (n^2, average n*log(n)) - choose a pivot, separate 2 sides in bigger or smaller, place pivot in center of division, start again
- trees: height is log(n). Visiting can be pre order, in order, post order - log(n) if binary.
- binary search: log(n) on sorted array
- hash table: map values to a hash. Collision with chaining (list of elements)
- stack, queue, linked list
- balanced trees
- graphs: directed or undirected, BFS, DFS (labyrinth)

## Refactoring

- Creation
  - replace constructor with creation methods
  - move creation to factory
  - encapsulate with factory or builder
- simplification
- generalization

## Concurrency

- threads run on shared memory, processes run independent
- mutex owns a resource while using it
- semaphore makes a task wait until it can continue

## Distributed Objects

- REST: GET to fetch, PUT to modify, POST to insert, DELETE to remove

## Networking

- layers
  - Physical (cable)
  - Data Link (Logical link)
  - Network (routing)
  - Transport (reliable packages)
  - Session (TCP/IP)
  - Presentation (translation)
  - App (HTML)
