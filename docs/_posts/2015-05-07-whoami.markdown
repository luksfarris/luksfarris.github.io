## The kid with one million unfinished projects

Among the things I have purported to be, I am an artist, a musician/producer, a natural athlete and a game developer.
To tell you the truth I am an [average artist](), I've only produced 
[bad stuff]() for myself, I made some [shitty games](), and I won't even link to any sports.

I am a young adult based in SÃ£o Paulo. Taller than most people, and a little overweight (hopefully not for long). White male, brunette, brown eyes. I'm avarage on every aspect. Extremely nice and polite, maybe too much. If I wanted to ask you a question, I'd probably start off by asking for permission to do so. My alignment in D&amp;D would be lawful good, nerds.

Now for some facts: I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am pursuing a MSc degree in machine learning and bioinformatics. I work (and have worked for a while) as a software engineer.

This is a personal experience. I found that writing about myself helps me discover aspects of my life I was unaware of, prior to thinking about it. In this site I will share my experiences and thoughts.
