## And the post modern drama of a lost generation

Maybe this has to do with my latest growing addiction to [dpat](https://soundcloud.com/dpat), but maybe listening to it is just a reason to write. The subtitle is aggressive, on
    purpose. I consider my generation (born in the early 90's) lost. Not lost as in useless or failed. Lost as in we
    don't know where to go, nor where we are.

We were taught a supposedly perfect recipe for a good life: __Study hard, build a career, create a family,
        retire, die__. Kids my age recently graduated, or are about to. You know what I see? A bunch of people
    who wanted to be artists, musicians, and many other lost dreams; but became lawyers, engineers, and doctors.

This situation is the cause for the disease I call post-modern drama (I've had it for about five years), which many
    times leads to the following symptoms - you probably have a good portion of them:

- Stress
- Distress
- Apathy
- Insomnia
- Depression

There are deeper problems, such as failed relationships, unsatisfying jobs, procrastination, and sedentarism. Is
    there a better way to die inside? I often spend nights awoke, sitting on the edge of my bedroom window, gazing upon
    the empty streets. Thinking about jumping. Just thinking - I won't jump - there are still too many dreams, too many
    unfinished projects. The thought of it somehow brings me peace.
