## The story of the boy who never said no

Have you ever seen the movie [Yes Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068680/)? Sometimes I
    feel like that movie was based on me. I have a real problem saying no to people. It is one of the reasons why I have
    so many unfinished projects.

I get so caught up in so many things I'm doing for other people, I don't really have time for myself. Heck,
    sometimes I can't even say no to myself.

One of these days I read an article about how saying no is good to everyone. Basically you won't compromise, and the
    person asking you will have to deal with it. The article was referring to software features, but it applies well to
    life. When you say no to someone's request, it means you want to focus on what really matters to you. Afterall, we
    should do what matters the most to ourselves, not to someone else.

Keep in mind who you are, and what you want to do with your life. I've been using mine to serve others, and I've
    called myself free the whole time. Everyday I let go of something or someone. Everyday I learn a little more of what
    freedom really means.

I'm still far from it, but to recognize the way ahead is already something.
