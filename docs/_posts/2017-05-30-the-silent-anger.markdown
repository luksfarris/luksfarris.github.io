## Of Indignation

This sparked in me when I was discussing the relationship between me and my parents.
Let me give you a little context.

They are divorced, they live far away from each other, and I leave even farther away from both.
Me and my girlfriend will travel near them, and I argued against visiting them.
She was curious about it, and many exchanged words later, she concluded I’m angry at them.

This hit me hard. I never felt anger towards my parents. But I feed such resentment towards them.

I’m frustrated that they divorced, and I grew up without a father, and with a needful mother.
That they educated me to love a family that never loved itself.
To think the love of a son can be bought with money or things, when all I really needed was proper education.

They poisoned me with fast food and sugar, more addictive and damaging than the very drugs they told me not to use.
Instead of teaching me how to grow my own food, how to eat properly and live a healthy life.

They sold me the lie that graduation, hard work, and money, would bring happiness.
Taking me to Disneyland instead of Paris, amusement parks instead of museums.
The fake promise that believing in a god would bring inner peace, instead of teaching me how to think for myself.


They let me sit for hours every day in front of a television, brainwashing consumerism into my head every 7 minutes.
Watching cartoons that didn’t teach any real values. Just so they wouldn’t have to deal with the burden of a son,
and could live their lives as if I didn’t exist. They let me sit in front of a bright screen for hours everyday,
browsing violence, even more commercials, pornography, racism, and sexism.
Instead of teaching me morals, and feeding me content that would actually teach me how to be a good person.

Goethe had something to say about this:

> “Misunderstandings and neglect create more confusion in this world than trickery and malice.<br>
At any rate, the last two are certainly much less frequent.“

I cannot blame my parents, nor be angry at their ignorance. They were not prepared to have children.
