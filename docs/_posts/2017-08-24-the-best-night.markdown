## Of my entire life

It's 8pm, eastern european summer. Meaning 8 degrees celcius, still sunny. I'm going back home from work, accompanied
    by my russian girlfriend, after too long calls with undecisive americans. I stumble upon a french friend, that
    happens to be dating a gorgeous polish girl.

We decide to hang out on a park nearby, after stopping to buy some beers and peanuts. We sit by the lake, discussing
    things that seemed so important like work and money, while watching ducks fight for whatever food they can find. A
    couple of friends of the polish girl arrive; a couple. A finnish guy and a bulgarian girl. They hang out a little,
    and by 10pm, when it's unbearably cold, they invite us to their home.

We arrive in a warm lit flat, and me and the guys start rolling enough blunts to last the whole night. The bulgarian
    girl cooks some gluten free cinammon-oat snack. The finnish guy starts playing some Bonobo on his sound box, and
    teaches us a finnish card game called "Crap your pants". We play the game for hours long, smoking, and drinking, and
    laughing. 

Today is Thursday, and I'm back at the slave work. I keep thinking it was a dream, but it couldn't have been. I
    haven't slept.
