## Intro

Lately I've considered myself closer to the catholic religion. When I was younger I tried to understand religion from materialistic lenses, and this point of view has never worked for me. Honestly, it sounded like a lot of made up stuff. Nobody told me I should be reading from a symbolic perspective, and honestly I didn't know how. In other words, the more I studied Computer Science, the better I was at understanding with my _brain_, and the worse I was at understanding with my _heart_.

This brings us to Matthew 5-7, also known as the Sermon on the Mount. If there is a part of the bible worth discussing, analyzing, internalizing, this is it. This is the one. You've probably come accross references, quotes, and citations of it over and over, on one media or another.

There is a barrier to this text though. You cannot read it with your 21st century secular, material, scientific mind. It was written by many, many generations of people viewed the world through symbols and metaphors. This is why I feel like there is a need to revise it.

Therefore I'm writing a new, secular revision of it. It's not a 1-to-1 translation. Mostly so I can keep track of all the metaphors I've managed to decipher as I mature my  _reading with the heart_ abilities. If you think I misunderstood something, or if you can offer deeper insight into this, please **do** reach out - my email's in the bottom of the page. 

# Sermon on the Mount (Secular Rewrite)

## Part 1

[3] Lucky are the poor, for they may find true happiness. [4] Lucky are those who mourn, for they may be comforted. [5] Lucky are the gentle, for they may find fulfillment. [6] Lucky are those who seek justice, for they may see it served. [7] Lucky are the merciful, for they may be shown mercy. [8] Lucky are the honest, for they may see the best of themselves. [9] Lucky are the peaceful, for they may be loved. [10] Lucky are the persecuted because of righteousness, for they may find true happiness.

[11] You're lucky when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of your self-improvement. [12] Rejoice and be glad, because your future may be great, for in the same way they persecuted all the great people who came before you.

[13] `TO DO: I have no idea what the salt means`.

[14] Imagine you're the inspiring light others need. [15] People don't light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. [16] In the same way, let your virtue shine before others, so that they may see your good deeds and be inspired to become better versions of themselves.

[17] Do not think you should abolish morals or ethics; you should instead fulfill them. [18] For truly I tell you, until your last days on earth, nothing you do will by any means change them. [19] Therefore anyone who disrespects good morals and ethics, and teaches others accordingly will never be truly happy, but whoever practices and teaches these will be find great happinness. [20] For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of government and the legislators, you will certainly not find happiness.

[21] You may have heard that it was said to the people long ago:
> You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment - Exodus 20:13

[22] But I tell you that anyone who is angry at someone else will and be subject to judgment by themselves (`due to guilt?`). Again, anyone who speaks to someone else with comtempt will forever judge themselves.

[23] Therefore, if you are trying to do something good and remember that someone has something against you, [24] stop right away. First go and be reconciled to them; then come back and do your good act.

[25] Settle legal matters quickly. Someone may sue you, and hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the police, and you may be thrown into prison. [26] Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

[27] You may have heard that it was said:
> You shall not commit adultery - Exodus 20:14

[28] But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman with desire is already cheating in his heart. [29] If your right eye causes you to cheat, keep it closed. It is better for you to stop seeing than to lose your opportunity to be loved. [30] And if your right hand causes you to cheat, keep it in your pocket. It is better for you to avoid contacts than to lose your opportunity to be loved.

[31] It has been said:
> Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce - Deuteronomy 24:1

[32] But I tell you that anyone who divorces his/her partner, makes him/her the victim of cheating, and anyone who marries a divorced man/woman is cheating.

[33] Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago:
> Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made

[34] But I tell you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven [35] nor by the things that are meaningful to you. [36] And do not swear by yourself, for you cannot make even one hair grow white or black. [37] All you need to say is simply **Yes** or **No**; anything beyond this is a lie.

[38] You have heard that it was said:
> Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth - Exodus 21:24

[39] But I tell you, do not resist a spiteful person. If anyone hits you, let them see it doesn't affect you. [40] And if anyone tries to take something away from you, hand them even more. [41] If anyone makes you walk a mile, walk two. [42] Give to those who ask you, and do not turn away from those who want to borrow from you.

[43] You have heard that it was said:
> Love your neighbor and hate your enemy - Leviticus 19:18

[44] But I tell you, love your enemies and cheer for those who persecute you, [45] so that you yourself may be loved. The sun rises for the bad and the good, and the rain falls on the righteous and the unrighteous. [46] If you love those who love you, how does that make you better? Don't bad people do it too? [47] And if you greet only your friends, what are you doing more than others? [48] Be perfect, therefore, as we all have the potential to be perfect.
