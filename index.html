          <h2>>whoami<span>The kid with one million unfinished projects</span></h2>
            <p>Among the things I have purported to be, I am an artist, a musician/producer,  a natural athlete and a game developer. To tell you the truth I am an <a href="https://www.behance.net/luksfarris" target="_blank">average artist</a>, I've only produced <a href="https://soundcloud.com/luksfarris" target="_blank">bad stuff</a> for myself, I made some <a href="http://luksfarris.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank">shitty games</a>, and I won't even link to any sports.</p>
            <p>I am a young adult based in SÃ£o Paulo. Taller than most people, and a little overweight (hopefully not for long). White male, brunette, brown eyes. Extremely nice and polite, maybe too much. If I wanted to ask you a question, I'd probably start off by asking for permission to do so. My alignment in D&amp;D would be lawful good, nerds.</p>
            <p>Now for some facts: I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am pursuing a MSc degree in machine learning and bioinformatics. I work (and have worked for a while) as a software engineer.</p>
            <p>This is a personal experience. I found that writing about myself helps me discover aspects of my life I was unaware of, prior to thinking about it. In this site I will share my experiences and thoughts.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned</p>

            <h2>On Depression<span>And the post modern drama of a lost generation</span></h2>
            <p>Maybe this has to do with my latest growing addiction to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dpat" target="_blank">dpat</a>, but maybe listening to is just a reason to write. The subtitle is aggressive, on purpose. I consider my generation (born in the early 90's) lost. No lost as in useless or failed. Lost as in we don't know where to go, nor where we are.</p>
            <p> We were taught a supposedly perfect recipe for a good life: <strong>Study hard, build a career, create a family, retire, die</strong>. Kids my age recently graduated, or are about to. You know what I see? A bunch of people who wanted to be artists, musicians, and many other lost dreams; but became lawyers, engineers and doctors.</p>
            <p> This situation is the cause for the disease I call post modern drama (I've had it for about five years), which many times lead to the following symptoms - you probably have a good portion of them:</p>
            <p>
            - Stress</br>
            - Distress</br>
            - Apathy</br>
            - Insomnia</br>
            - Depression</br>
            </p>
            <p>There are deeper problems, such as failed relationships, shitty jobs, procrastination, sedentarism. Is there a better way to die inside? I often spend nights awoken, sitting on the edge of my bedroom window, gazing upon the empty streets. Thinking about jumping. Just thinking, I'll never jump; I still have too many dreams, too many unfinished projects. The thought of it somehow brings me peace.</p>
            <p>Don't stop dreaming</p>

            <h2>Saying Yes<span>The story of the boy who never said no</span></h2>
            <p>Have you ever seen the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068680/" target="_blank">Yes Man</a>? Sometimes I feel like that movie was based on me. I have a real problem saying no to people. It is one of the reasons I have so many unfinished projects. </p> 
            <p> I get so caught up in so many things I'm doing for other people, I don't really have time to myself. Hell, I can't even say no to myself sometimes. </p>
            <p>One of these days I read an article about how saying no is good to everyone. Basically you won't compromise, and the person asking you will have to deal with it. The article was referring to software features, but it applies well to life. When you say no to someone's request, it means you  want to focus on what really matters to you. Afterall, we should do what matters the most to ourselves, not to someone else. </p>
            <p>Keep in mind who you are, and what you want to do with your life. I've been using mine to serve others, and I've called myself free my whole life. Everyday I let go of something or someone. Everyday I learn a little more of what free really means.</p>
            <p>I'm still far from it, but to recognize I'm on the way is already something.</p>
            <p>Start saying no.</p>
